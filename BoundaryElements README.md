# Boundary Elements of a 2D Array (Java)

This Java program prints only the boundary elements of a given 2D array.

## Overview

The `BoundaryElements` class contains a method `printBoundaryElements(int[][] matrix)` that prints the elements located at the boundary of a 2D integer array.

The `main` method demonstrates the usage of this method with a sample 2D array.

## Features

-   Handles null or empty matrices, printing an error message in such cases.
-   Handles matrices with only one row or one column, printing all elements.
-   Prints the boundary elements in a clockwise direction: top row, right column, bottom row (reversed), and left column (reversed).
-   Clear and concise code with comments explaining each step.
