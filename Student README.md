# Student Management System in Java

This repository contains a Java program that manages student information, including their name, grade, and a list of enrolled courses. The program defines a `Student` class with functionalities to add and remove courses for a student.

## Features

* **Student Class:**
    * Stores student details such as `name` (String), `grade` (int), and a list of `courses` (List of Strings) they are enrolled in.
    * Uses an `ArrayList` to manage the list of courses, allowing for dynamic addition and removal.
    * Includes a constructor to initialize a `Student` object with a name and grade, and automatically initializes an empty list for courses.
    * Provides an `addCourse()` method to enroll a student in a new course. It checks if the course is already in the student's list to prevent duplicates.
    * Offers a `removeCourse()` method to unenroll a student from a course. It verifies if the course is in the student's list before attempting to remove it.
    * Includes a `displayStudentInfo()` method to print the student's name, grade, and the list of enrolled courses to the console.

* **Main Method:**
    * The `main` method within the `Student` class demonstrates how to create and interact with `Student` objects.
    * It creates a `Student` object named "John Doe" in grade 10.
    * It adds three courses ("Mathematics", "Science", "History") to the student's enrollment.
    * It attempts to add a duplicate course ("Mathematics") to show the duplicate check.
    * It removes the "Science" course from the student's enrollment.
    * It attempts to remove a course ("Art") that the student is not enrolled in, demonstrating the check for existing courses.
    * Finally, it displays the student's updated information, including the remaining enrolled courses.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.  **Download:** You can download the `Student.java` file from this repository.
3.  **Compilation:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved `Student.java`, and compile the code using the Java compiler:
    ```bash
    javac Student.java
    ```
4.  **Execution:** After successful compilation, run the program using the Java Virtual Machine:
    ```bash
    java Student
    ```

## Usage

The `main` method in the `Student` class provides a basic demonstration. When you run the program, it will output the following to the console:

You can modify the `main` method to create and manage multiple `Student` objects, add more courses, or implement more complex scenarios for student enrollment.

## Potential Enhancements

* Implement a system to manage a list of all students.
* Add functionality to search for students by name or grade.
* Include methods to update a student's grade or other information.
* Implement features for assigning and managing teachers for courses.
* Integrate with data storage (e.g., files, databases) to persist student data.
