# Simple Bank Management System in Java

This repository contains a basic Java program that simulates a simple bank management system. It includes two main classes: `Account` to represent a customer's bank account and `Bank` to manage multiple accounts.

## Features

* **Account Class:**
    * Represents a bank account with attributes for account number, customer name, and balance.
    * Provides methods to deposit and withdraw money, with basic validation.
    * Includes getter methods to access account information.
    * Offers a method to display account details.

* **Bank Class:**
    * Manages a collection of `Account` objects using a `HashMap` for efficient access by account number.
    * Allows adding new accounts to the bank.
    * Enables removing existing accounts.
    * Provides methods to deposit and withdraw money from specific accounts.
    * Includes a method to display the details of all accounts in the bank.

* **BankSystem Class:**
    * The main class that demonstrates the functionality of the `Account` and `Bank` classes.
    * Creates a `Bank` object.
    * Creates and adds sample `Account` objects to the bank.
    * Performs deposit and withdrawal transactions.
    * Demonstrates removing an account and attempting to perform an operation on a removed account.
    * Displays the details of all remaining accounts.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:** You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2.  **Download:** You can download the `Account.java`, `Bank.java`, and `BankSystem.java` files from this repository.
3.  **Compilation:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the Java files, and compile them using the Java compiler:
    ```bash
    javac Account.java Bank.java BankSystem.java
    ```
4.  **Execution:** After successful compilation, run the `BankSystem` class using the Java Virtual Machine:
    ```bash
    java BankSystem
    ```

## Usage

The `BankSystem`'s `main` method provides a simple demonstration of how to use the `Account` and `Bank` classes. You can extend this `main` method or create new classes to implement more complex banking operations or a user interface.

The program output will show the creation of accounts, deposit and withdrawal transactions, account removal, and the details of the remaining accounts in the bank.

## Potential Enhancements

* Implement more robust error handling and input validation.
* Add features like transferring funds between accounts.
* Include account history tracking.
* Implement different types of accounts (e.g., savings, checking) with varying interest rates or fees.
* Develop a user interface (command-line or GUI) for easier interaction with the bank system.
* Persist account data to a file or database.
